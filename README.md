# Neverwinter Character Builder
React-Native app for build creation of Characters of the MMORPG Neverwinter.

## Ok. Why an app for this?
Decided to make this app as both to tackle my curiosity about the React Native + Redux technology, and my desire to experiment new character builds of the game I play.

This project is supposed to be a fun and educating project about the technology in use.
